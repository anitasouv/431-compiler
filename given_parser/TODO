SSA milestone
run small arm code? (how to do...)
run llvm with input and output?

Make the header for ARM and LLVM (.com and .text etc)
make end of function things for arm  (eg section	.rodata)
Arm: need lower case for the instructions

need to redirect output to the input files and diff it with test output (LLVM)
figure out loading from stack space and also local space



clean up the checks for sturct and change the struct type to pass back *

notes:
ARM: always declare the __aeabi_idiv

arm -> declare -> dont need to do?
