SSA milestone
run small arm code? (how to do...)
run llvm with input and output?

Make the header for ARM and LLVM (.com and .text etc)
make end of function things for arm  (eg section	.rodata)
Arm: need lower case for the instructions

figure out loading from stack space and also local space


LLVM Milstones work
ARM -> fix the read and print statements


clean up the checks for sturct and change the struct type to pass back *

notes:
ARM: always declare the __aeabi_idiv

arm -> declare -> dont need to do?
