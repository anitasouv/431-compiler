(All of the following insructions are to be done in the given_parser directory)

How to build compiler:
 - run the script "makeJava.sh"
 - if that does not work then run:
      javac *.java ast/*.java cfg/*.java llvm/*.java arm/*.java

To use the compiler:
 - run:
      java MiniCompiler <Mini file> <-llvm OR -arm> > <name of output file>
 - "-llvm" will generate the register based llvm code
 - "-arm"  will generate a partially working arm code of the mini file
 - you can also optionally do "-json" for the json representation of the mini file
 - to run the benchmarks you can run "./regrScript.sh"
   - this will run the script that will compile the our compiler and then run all of the benchmarks using the given input 
   - it will also diff the output of our compiler with the given output
